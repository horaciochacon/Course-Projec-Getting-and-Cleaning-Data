Horacio Chac√≥n-Torrico

## Overview

This is the repository for the coursera "Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project". The goal of this assignment is to demonstrate the student's ability to read raw data and transform it in a tidy and ready to analyze format.

## The Dataset

The data set used for this assignment is called "Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set" and the complete information can be found in the following [link](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones). It comprises measurements from smartphones accelerometers performed during different activities (walking, standing, laying, etc.)

## The analysis

The assignment asks for the following tasks or steps:

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
